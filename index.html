   <div class="acc-item-content" aria-hidden="true" id="content-1">
    <p>Right now there are more than 150,000 students enrolled in online programs at SNHU, and each student has their own set of goals and reasons for attending. But here are three important ones to keep in mind.</p>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>1. Learn more, earn more</strong><br>
      The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the usual median weekly earnings of a worker with a bachelor's degree is $1,305 and $781 for those with a high school diploma. That's a 67% increase.<sup>1</sup></li><br>
    <li><strong>2. Lower your risk of unemployment</strong><br>
      Earning your college degree could also lead to more career stability. According to 2020 data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, just 5.5% of workers with a bachelor's degree were unemployed, compared to 9% of workers with only a high school diploma.<sup>1</sup></li><br>
    <li><strong>3. Be happier in your career</strong><br>
      The Pew Research Center found that 60% of workers with a bachelor's degree feel their job gives them a sense of identity, versus just 38% of those with a high school diploma or less.<sup>2</sup> Workers with at least a bachelor's degree were also almost twice as likely as those with no college education to say their job is a career.<sup>2</sup></li><br>
      <strong>Understanding the numbers</strong>
     <br>When reviewing job growth and salary information, it’s important to remember that actual numbers can vary due to many different factors—like years of experience in the role, industry of employment, geographic location, worker skill and economic conditions. Cited projections do not guarantee actual salary or job growth.

   <button aria-controls="content-9" aria-expanded="false" id="accordion-control-9" tabindex="0">How can I reduce tuition costs and/or make college more affordable?</button>
   <div class="acc-item-content" aria-hidden="true" id="content-9">
     <p>First off, it’s a great idea to think of this as a two-part question: 1) “How do I reduce tuition costs?” and 2) “How do I make college more affordable?”</p>
     <p>
    <strong>1. Reduce tuition costs</strong><br></p>
    <p>
    <strong>Choose an affordable university like SNHU</strong><br>
    As a nonprofit university, SNHU has some of the lowest online tuition in the nation.
     
    When comparing costs of universities, we recommend looking at the “cost per credit.” To get a sense of your overall cost, simply multiply the cost per credit by the number of credits you need for your degree. Most bachelor’s degrees are 120 credits.
     
    For example, SNHU’s online tuition cost is $320/credit — which is among the lowest tuition rates in the nation.

      <p>But remember, your actual cost may be a lot less. There are lots of ways to reduce that price! Call or text your admission counselor at 888.387.0861.</p>
      <p>
     <strong>Choose a university with a generous transfer credit policy like SNHU</strong><br>
     Our high level of student support, no set class times and generous transfer credit policy make SNHU a great university for students with previous college credits to finish their degrees. In fact, most online students enroll at SNHU with some transfer credits.</p>
     <p>
     At SNHU you, you can transfer up to
     <ul>
     <li>90 credits toward your bachelor’s degree</li>
     <li>45 credits toward your associate degree</li>
     <li>12 credits toward your master’s degree</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>For example, if you transferred 90 credits toward your bachelor’s degree, you could complete your degree in as little as 1 year. Call or text 888.387.0861 your admission counselor for a free credit evaluation to learn how quickly you can complete your degree at SNHU.

    <p><strong>Complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®)</strong><br>
     The U.S. Department of Education's office of Federal Student Aid provides more than $120 billion in financial aid to help pay for college or career school each year. It is the nation’s largest provider of loans, grants and work-study funds. Complete the <a href="https://studentaid.gov/" target="_blank">Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</a> to see if you qualify. Don’t forget SNHU's school code — 002580!</p>
     <p>The FAFSA should only take about 30 minutes to complete and is 100% free to submit. And since other schools may require a FAFSA for enrollment, it’s a good idea to fill it out, even if you don’t end up attending SNHU.</p>
     <p>Completing the FAFSA is the only way to determine if you’re eligible for federal aid in the form of</p>
     <ul>
      <li><strong>Grants</strong>, which don’t have to be paid back, reducing your tuition cost<sup>*</sup></li>
      <li><strong>Loans</strong>, which do have to be paid back but can make paying for college more affordable</li>
     </ul>
     <p><sup>*</sup>Students who fail to complete the academic period for which the Federal Pell Grant was offered will be asked to pay back a portion of the grant.</p>
     <p>Questions about financial aid or the FAFSA? Call an SNHU finance counselor today at 877.455.7648 for assistance.</p>
 
     <p><strong>Ask about employer tuition assistance</strong></p>
     <p>Many employers will assist with the cost of your degree in the form of tuition assistance, tuition discounts or tuition reimbursement. Some might fund it completely depending on how your tuition benefits work! Ask your employer if this benefit is available to you.</p>
     <p>SNHU also has partnerships with hundreds of employers across the country. Call or text an admission counselor at 888.387.0861 to find out if your employer is an SNHU partner.</p>
 
     <p><strong>2. Make college payments affordable.</strong></p>
     <p><strong>Consider student loans</strong></p>
     <p>After you've taken all the steps you can to reduce the cost of your tuition, it still may not be possible for you to pay out of pocket for your remaining costs. If that’s the case, student loans can help you fund your education.</p>
     <p>If you’re thinking about taking out one or more federal or private student loans, talk to our financial services team about smart borrowing practices and get all the information you need to fund your educational future. Keep in mind that you don't need to take out loans for the full amount you're approved for. It's important to borrow responsibly because you'll be responsible for paying back any student loans you take.</p>
     <p>Talk to an SNHU finance counselor today at 877.455.7648 to learn more.</p>
 
     <p><strong>Take fewer classes per term</strong></p>
     <p>Many SNHU students make college more affordable and achievable by taking only one class per term. This allows students to pay for tuition using savings rather than taking out loans while also setting a manageable pace for studying while working full time. Yes, it takes longer to graduate, but thousands of our SNHU students have earned their degrees this way!</p>
     <p>Note: Attending SNHU part time may affect your eligibility for financial aid. Call or text your admission counselor at 888.387.0861 to discuss your particular situation.</p>

   <div class="acc-item-content" aria-hidden="true" id="content-11">
    <p>Personal preferences, goals, academic progress, transfer credit eligibility, cost and time considerations are all factors that may affect how many years it takes to earn a degree. Here’s the breakdown:</p>
    <p><strong>Associate degree — usually 2 years</strong></p>
    <p>An associate degree usually requires 60 credits and is often referred to as a 2-year degree. But there are ways to finish an associate degree faster! At SNHU, you can transfer up to 45 previously earned college credits toward an associate degree, helping you get that credential even quicker.</p>
    <p>Associate degrees can often be applied when going on to earn your bachelor’s degree. Depending on which associate degree you earn, you could be halfway to your bachelor’s degree!</p>
 
    <p><strong>Bachelor’s degree — usually 4 years</strong></p>
    <p>Many factors will affect how long it takes to earn your degree, but 4 years is the traditional timetable to earn the 120 credits you need. At SNHU, students pursuing their bachelor's degree online typically take 1-2 courses per term. With six 8-week terms throughout the year, you can complete as many as 12 courses annually.</p>
    <p>If you’ve earned college credits at other universities, you may be eligible to transfer up to 90 credits toward your bachelor’s degree at SNHU, saving you time and money. Many of our students enroll at SNHU with transfer credits.</p>
 
    <p><strong>Master’s degrees — usually 1-2 years</strong></p>
    <p>How long it takes to get a master’s degree depends on you and the program you choose. Typically, it takes 1-2 years to complete. In some cases, you can finish in less time, and in others, you may want more time to progress through your courses or may need longer to meet specific program requirements. Your degree, college, desired pacing and personal goals are all factors to consider.</p>
    <p>One of the biggest variables when it comes to the length of a master’s degree is the number of credits. While bachelor’s degrees are typically 120 credits, making them 4-year degrees, master’s programs can vary greatly, ranging from 30-60 credits. For example, our MBA is 30 credits while our MFA in Creative Writing is 48 credits. </p>
